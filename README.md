# Home Assistant

üè† My (basic, but growing) Home Assistant configuration.

## Overview

I'm fairly new to the world of home automation, and what I've been playing with so far has barely scratched the surface of what I know is possible. If you've run into this repository interested in my configuration, here are some notes:

* Our household runs on HomeKit, as that's the platform I chose before getting into Home Assistant. We're an Apple household, and we're happy with it.
* Every IoT device we purchase needs to be able to easily be added to our home via Apple's Home App.
* Home Assistant serves to assist the main HomeKit setup, providing an API that I can use to control different parts of the house using non-Apple devices, such as my studio's Stream Deck via Bitfocus Companion's Home Assistant integration.
* Changes cannot disrupt our muscle memory when it comes to triggering automations via Siri, etc. I want to be able to play around with this, but I don't want to trip up my wife's expected usage of the existing system.

(This is all subject to change as I continue to learn about the ins-and-outs of the Home Assistant ecosystem.)
